Cursorless, a great open-source spoken programming language, lets users eliminate the need for a cursor entirely. In other words - software engineers can code at the speed of sound (increased productivity) and all computer users can reduce strain on their wrists to prevent injury (preventative healthcare).

Your input and support will help Cursorless founder, Pokey Rule, develop the follow feature requests as quickly as possible.

- Develop this
- Deveoph that
- I think actually listing a few of your existing plans is ideal - shows what people are getting “in on”

### Goals

Cursorless needs a dedicated, full-time software engineer on staff. This will cost $5,000 USD per month. The Enablement Group guides development and the participation fees contribute to this crucial funding. Cursorless will always be open source.
